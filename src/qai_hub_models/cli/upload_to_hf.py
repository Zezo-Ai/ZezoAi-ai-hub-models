"""``qai-hub-models upload-to-hf`` implementation.

Publishes a recipe folder to Hugging Face as one repo holding the recipe source
and a generated model card. Shipping the code is the whole point: a published
repo can be registered, installed, and re-exported, which is not true of the
binary-only repos the community org accumulated before this command existed.

Nothing is compiled, and no artifact is special-cased -- the folder is published
as it sits on disk, minus build output (:data:`_EXCLUDE_FROM_UPLOAD`) and the
external-repo clones under ``external_repos/``
(:func:`_ignore_external_repo_clones`), which the recipe re-fetches from its
manifest. Consumers compile it themselves with ``qai-hub-models export``.

Repos go to the **contributor's own namespace** (``<username>/<model_id>``), not
into the community org. That namespace is enforced by HuggingFace, so ownership
is real, nobody races for a name, and publishing needs no org membership at all.
Visibility is decoupled from location: every card is tagged
:data:`COMMUNITY_TAG`, and HuggingFace's search on that tag is the index --
live, sortable, and faceted, so nothing has to be curated by hand.

Repos are created **public**, so publishing is one command and the model is in
the index immediately. ``--private`` opts into reviewing the rendered card
first; going public is then a manual step on HuggingFace.

Re-uploading is an update: one commit per upload, tagged ``v1``, ``v2``, ... so
any version stays addressable via ``register --version``. Numbering is read off
the repo's existing tags, never from local state.

Updating a repo requires having created it -- see :func:`_assert_may_overwrite`.
Org members share write access on HuggingFace, so without that check one
contributor could commit over another's published model.
