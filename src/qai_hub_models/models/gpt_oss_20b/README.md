# [GPT-OSS-20B: State-of-the-art Mixture of Experts large language model with extended context length for text generation tasks](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/gpt_oss_20b)

GPT-OSS-20B is a 20.9B parameter Mixture of Experts (MoE) language model with 32 experts (4 active per token). It features an extended 131K context length with YARN rope scaling and uses a GPT-4o compatible tokenizer. The model is quantized to MXFP4 for efficient on-device deployment.

This is based on the implementation of GPT-OSS-20B found [here](https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF).
This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance across various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/gpt_oss_20b).

Qualcomm AI Hub Models uses [Qualcomm AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com) to compile, profile, and evaluate this model. [Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.
