# [Whisper-Medium-Quantized: Transformer-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for multilingual transcription and translation available on HuggingFace](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/whisper_medium_quantized)

We have applied w8a16 quantization to significantly enhance performance and efficiency. HuggingFace Whisper-Medium ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model is a state-of-the-art system designed for transcribing spoken language into written text. This model is based on the transformer architecture and has been optimized for edge inference by replacing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) with Single-Head Attention (SHA) and linear layers with convolutional (conv) layers. It exhibits robust performance in realistic, noisy environments, making it highly reliable for real-world applications. Specifically, it excels in long-form transcription, capable of accurately transcribing audio clips up to 30 seconds long. Time to the first token is the encoder's latency, while time to each additional token is decoder's latency, where we assume a max decoded length specified below.

This is based on the implementation of Whisper-Medium-Quantized found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/v4.42.3/src/transformers/models/whisper).
This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance across various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/whisper_medium_quantized).

Qualcomm AI Hub Models uses [Qualcomm AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com) to compile, profile, and evaluate this model. [Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.

## Quick Start

Use our lightweight command-line interface to inspect and download Whisper-Medium-Quantized:

```bash
pip install qai_hub_models_cli # (the CLI is also available with the qai-hub-models package)

# Inspect the model and list the available download options
qai-hub-models info Whisper-Medium-Quantized

# Print performance and accuracy metrics
qai-hub-models perf Whisper-Medium-Quantized
qai-hub-models numerics Whisper-Medium-Quantized

# Download a ready-to-deploy asset
qai-hub-models fetch Whisper-Medium-Quantized --runtime qnn_context_binary --precision w8a16
```
See the [CLI README](../../../../cli/README.md)
for the full list of commands and filters.

## Deploying Whisper-Medium-Quantized on-device

This model is compatible with the Qualcomm Voice AI SDK. Download the SDK from the [Qualcomm Package Manager](https://qpm.qualcomm.com/#/main/tools/details/VoiceAI_ASR) to deploy this model on-device.

## Setup
### 1. Install System-Level Dependencies
#### Linux
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg libportaudio2
 ```

#### Windows
```
winget install ffmpeg
```

### 2. Install the package
Install the base package, then use the `qai-hub-models` CLI to install this
recipe's dependencies:
```bash
# NOTE: 3.10 <= PYTHON_VERSION < 3.14 is supported.
pip install qai-hub-models
qai-hub-models install whisper_medium_quantized
```

### 3. Configure Qualcomm® AI Hub Workbench
Sign-in to [Qualcomm® AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com/) with your
Qualcomm® ID. Once signed in navigate to `Account -> Settings -> API Token`.

With this API token, you can configure your client to run models on the cloud
hosted devices.
```bash
qai-hub configure --api_token API_TOKEN
```
Navigate to [docs](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com/docs/) for more information.

## Run CLI Demo
Run the following simple CLI demo to verify the model is working end to end:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.whisper_medium_quantized.demo
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

## Export for on-device deployment
To run the model on Qualcomm® devices, you must export the model for use with an edge runtime such as
TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, or Qualcomm AI Engine Direct.
Use the following command to export the model:
```bash
qai-hub-models export whisper_medium_quantized --target-runtime qnn_context_binary --precision w8a16 --device "Samsung Galaxy S25 (Family)"
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option.
