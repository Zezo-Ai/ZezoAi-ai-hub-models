        Zip ``entries``, upload the bundle to QDC, and submit an automated job for it.

        See :meth:`DeviceFarm.submit_bundle` for the shared contract. QDC
        specifics: ``hub_device_name`` is mapped to a QDC target device via
        :data:`HUB_DEVICE_TO_QDC_DEVICE_MAP`; the zipped bundle is uploaded as
        a single ``ArtifactType.TESTSCRIPT`` artifact; and, unlike the AWS
        backend, ``entry_script`` is supported and forwarded to QDC verbatim
        (QDC runs it directly rather than requiring a fixed platform test spec).
        Submission blocks (see :meth:`_submit_automated_job`) until a job slot
        is available under ``self.job_limit`` or ``timeout`` elapses.

        Parameters
        ----------
        hub_device_name
            QAI Hub device name; looked up in ``HUB_DEVICE_TO_QDC_DEVICE_MAP``
            to determine the QDC target device and test framework.
        entries
            ``(source_path, arcname)`` pairs zipped into the uploaded test
            bundle.
        entry_script
            Path (relative to the bundle root) QDC should execute as the
            job's entry point.
        job_name
            Job name shown in QDC; truncated to ``QDC_JOB_NAME_LIMIT``.
        timeout
            Maximum seconds to wait for a free job slot (``self.job_limit``)
            before raising.

        Returns
        -------
        job_id : str
            The QDC job id returned by ``qdc_api.submit_job``.

        ------
        TimeoutError
