        Zip ``entries``, upload the bundle, and submit an automated job for it.

        Implementations queue the job on the backend's device pool and return
        immediately once submission succeeds; they do not block for job
        completion (see :meth:`status`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        hub_device_name
            QAI Hub device name identifying which physical device/pool to run
            on. Each backend maps this to its own device identifier (e.g. a
            QDC target id or an AWS device ARN).
        entries
            ``(source_path, arcname)`` pairs (see :func:`create_zip_from_entries`)
            describing the files to zip into the test bundle uploaded to the
            device.
        entry_script
            Path (relative to the bundle root) of the script the device
            should execute as the job's entry point. Backend support for this
            varies -- some backends require a fixed platform-specific test
            spec instead and reject a non-``None`` value.
        job_name
            Human-readable job name shown in the backend's UI/API. May be
            truncated to the backend's length limit.
        timeout
            Maximum seconds to wait for a device/job slot to free up before
            submission gives up. Does not bound job execution time.

        Returns
        -------
        job_id : str
            Backend-native identifier for the submitted job (e.g. a QDC job
            id or an AWS Device Farm run ARN). Passed back into :meth:`status`,
            :meth:`result`, and the log-retrieval methods.

        timeout
            Maximum seconds to poll before giving up.
